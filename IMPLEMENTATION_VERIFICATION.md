# Champions Leaderboard Implementation Verification

## Summary
This document verifies the implementation of the champions leaderboard functionality as per the requirements.

## Requirements Implementation Status

### 1. âœ… Department and Event Constants
- **Requirement**: Store department names with their IDs in a Java class using Map
- **Implementation**: 
  - `DepartmentConstants.java` - Contains static Map of department IDs to names
  - `EventConstants.java` - Contains static Map of event IDs to names
  - Both provide utility methods: `getAllDepartments()`, `getDepartmentName()`, `isValidDepartmentId()`

### 2. âœ… Champions Count Database
- **Requirement**: Create champions_count collection in Neon database to store dept ID and count
- **Implementation**:
  - `ChampionsCount.java` entity with `deptId` and `count` fields
  - `ChampionsCountRepository.java` JPA repository for database operations
  - Table name: `champions_count` in PostgreSQL/Neon database

### 3. âœ… Event Results Storage
- **Requirement**: Store winners and runners list with event details
- **Implementation**:
  - `EventResult.java` MongoDB document stores:
    - `eventId` and `eventName`
    - `winnersDept`, `winnersDeptName`
    - `runnersDept`, `runnersDeptName`
    - `coordinatorId`
    - `submittedAt` timestamp
  - Collection name: `EVENT_RESULTS` in MongoDB

### 4. âœ… Champions Counter Function
- **Requirement**: Function that increments count for both winners and runners
- **Implementation**:
  - `ChampionsService.championsCounter()` method
  - Accepts `winnerDeptId` and `runnerDeptId` parameters
  - For each department:
    - Fetches existing count from database
    - Increments count by 1
    - Saves updated count back to database
  - If department doesn't exist, creates new entry with count = 1

### 5. âœ… Immediate Leaderboard Update
- **Requirement**: Call champions counter immediately after storing results
- **Implementation**:
  - `AdminService.submitResult()` calls `championsService.championsCounter()` immediately after saving result
  - This ensures leaderboard data is updated without delay

### 6. âœ… Leaderboard API Endpoint
- **Requirement**: Fetch and display top 5 departments dynamically
- **Implementation**:
  - `ChampionsService.getLeaderboard()` method:
    - Fetches all champion counts from database
    - Sorts by count in descending order
    - Returns top 5 entries
    - Includes `deptId`, `deptName`, and `count` for each entry
  - Exposed via `/api/champions/leaderboard` endpoint

### 7. âœ… Dynamic Leaderboard on Home Page
- **Requirement**: Display leaderboard that refreshes every 5 minutes
- **Implementation**:
  - `HomeComponent` displays leaderboard with rankings
  - Shows medals (ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰) for top 3 positions
  - Auto-refreshes every 5 minutes using RxJS interval
  - Also refreshes on component initialization
  - Displays "No results yet" message when no data available

### 8. âœ… Admin Panel Form with Dropdowns
- **Requirement**: Display dropdowns for departments and events with names and IDs
- **Implementation**:
  - Admin panel loads departments from `/api/champions/departments`
  - Admin panel loads events from `/api/champions/events`
  - Dropdowns display format: "Department Name - DEPT_ID"
  - Form uses `ngModel` for two-way data binding
  - When submitted, only IDs are sent to backend

### 9. âœ… Input Validation
- **Requirement**: Validate department and event IDs before submission
- **Implementation**:
  - `AdminService.submitResult()` validates:
    - Event ID using `EventConstants.isValidEventId()`
    - Winner department ID using `DepartmentConstants.isValidDepartmentId()`
    - Runner department ID using `DepartmentConstants.isValidDepartmentId()`
  - Throws `IllegalArgumentException` if any validation fails

### 10. âœ… Display Names in Results View
- **Requirement**: Show department and event names in results list
- **Implementation**:
  - Backend stores both IDs and names when saving results
  - View Scores component displays names with fallback to IDs
  - Shows event name, winner department name, runner department name

## Code Quality

### âœ… Build Status
- **Backend**: Compiles successfully with Maven
- **Frontend**: Builds successfully with Angular CLI
- No compilation errors in either codebase

### âœ… Code Organization
- Clean separation of concerns (Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository)
- Constants centralized in dedicated classes
- Proper use of DTOs for API requests
- Models properly annotated for JPA and MongoDB

### âœ… Error Handling
- Validation at service layer
- Proper exception handling
- Null checks and optional handling

## Testing Notes

While the application cannot be run end-to-end in this sandboxed environment due to database connectivity restrictions, the following has been verified:

1. âœ… Code compiles without errors
2. âœ… All required classes and methods exist
3. âœ… Proper annotations and configurations present
4. âœ… Logic flow is correct according to requirements
5. âœ… Database schema matches requirements

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to production environment:

1. Ensure PostgreSQL (Neon) database is accessible for champions_count table
2. Ensure MongoDB is accessible for event results storage
3. Update `application.properties` with correct database connection strings
4. The leaderboard will automatically update every 5 minutes on the home page
5. Immediate updates occur when coordinators submit results

## API Endpoints Summary

### Champions Endpoints
- `GET /api/champions/leaderboard` - Get top 5 departments
- `GET /api/champions/departments` - Get all departments map
- `GET /api/champions/events` - Get all events map

### Admin Endpoints
- `POST /api/admin/submit-result` - Submit event results (triggers champions counter)
- `GET /api/admin/results` - Get all results
- `PUT /api/admin/results/{id}` - Update result

## Conclusion

All requirements from the problem statement have been successfully implemented:
- âœ… Champions counter function with database storage
- âœ… Dynamic leaderboard with auto-refresh
- âœ… Dropdown lists for departments and events
- âœ… Proper data storage with names and IDs
- âœ… Immediate update after result submission
- âœ… Input validation
- âœ… Clean, maintainable code structure
