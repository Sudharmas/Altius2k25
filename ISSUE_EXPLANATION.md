## Understanding the Confusion

The reference to "Claude Sonnet 4.5" appears to be:
1. **A misunderstanding**: Claude Sonnet is an AI assistant, not a feature of this application
2. **Misdirected**: The issue may have been meant for a different repository
3. **Unrelated**: This Event Management System has no AI integration requirements

## Recommendations

### If you were trying to use Claude as a development assistant:
- Claude (and similar AI assistants) work at the IDE/development environment level
- No code changes are needed in the repository itself
- Configure your IDE or development tools to use AI assistants

### If you want to add AI features to the application:
This would be a **new feature request** requiring:
- Integration with Claude API (requires API keys)
- New backend endpoints for AI interactions
- Frontend components for AI-powered features
- Security considerations for API key management
- Additional costs for API usage

### If this is a misdirected issue:
- Please verify the correct repository
- Provide specific error messages if any exist
- Clarify the actual requirement

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Repository is fully functional - ready for deployment
2. ✅ All build processes verified
3. ✅ Documentation is complete and accurate
4. ⏳ Awaiting user clarification on actual requirements (if any)
