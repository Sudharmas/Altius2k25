# Champions Leaderboard Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Champions Counter and Dynamic Leaderboard feature for the Altius 2k25 Event Management System.

## Problem Statement
When coordinators submit event results (winners and runners), the system should:
1. Store department IDs (not names) in the database
2. Automatically update a champions count for each department
3. Display a dynamic leaderboard on the home page showing top 5 departments
4. Auto-refresh the leaderboard every 5 minutes

## Implementation Details

### Backend Components

#### 1. Constants Classes
**Location**: `backend/src/main/java/com/altius/eventmanagement/constants/`

- **DepartmentConstants.java**: Contains a static map of department IDs to department names
  - DEPT001 ‚Üí Computer Science and Engineering
  - DEPT002 ‚Üí Electronics and Communication Engineering
  - DEPT003 ‚Üí Mechanical Engineering
  - etc.

- **EventConstants.java**: Contains a static map of event IDs to event names
  - EVNT001 ‚Üí Tic-Tac-Toe
  - EVNT012 ‚Üí Chess
  - EVNT004 ‚Üí BDRF
  - EVNT006 ‚Üí Carrom

#### 2. Database Entity
**Location**: `backend/src/main/java/com/altius/eventmanagement/model/ChampionsCount.java`

- JPA Entity for Neon PostgreSQL database
- Table: `champions_count`
- Fields:
  - `id` (Long): Auto-generated primary key
  - `deptId` (String): Unique department ID (e.g., "DEPT001")
  - `count` (Integer): Number of prizes won (default: 0)

#### 3. Repository
**Location**: `backend/src/main/java/com/altius/eventmanagement/repository/ChampionsCountRepository.java`

- JPA Repository interface
- Custom method: `findByDeptId(String deptId)` to find department count by ID

#### 4. Service Layer
**Location**: `backend/src/main/java/com/altius/eventmanagement/service/ChampionsService.java`

Key Methods:
- **championsCounter(winnerDeptId, runnerDeptId)**: 
  - Called automatically when results are submitted
  - Increments count by 1 for both winner and runner departments
  - Creates new record if department doesn't exist
  - Uses @Transactional to ensure data consistency

- **getLeaderboard()**: 
  - Fetches all department counts
  - Sorts by count in descending order
  - Returns top 5 departments
  - Includes dept ID, dept name, and count

- **getDepartments()**: Returns all departments map
- **getEvents()**: Returns all events map

**Location**: `backend/src/main/java/com/altius/eventmanagement/service/AdminService.java`

Updated `submitResult()` method:
- Saves event result to MongoDB
- Immediately calls `championsService.championsCounter()`
- Ensures leaderboard is updated without delay

#### 5. Controller Layer
**Location**: `backend/src/main/java/com/altius/eventmanagement/controller/ChampionsController.java`

REST Endpoints:
- `GET /api/champions/leaderboard` - Get top 5 departments
- `GET /api/champions/departments` - Get all departments map
- `GET /api/champions/events` - Get all events map

### Frontend Components

#### 1. Models
**Location**: `frontend/src/app/models/models.ts`

Added interface:
```typescript
export interface ChampionsCount {
  deptId: string;
  deptName: string;
  count: number;
}
```

#### 2. Services
**Location**: `frontend/src/app/services/admin.service.ts`

Added methods:
- `getLeaderboard()`: Observable<ChampionsCount[]>
- `getDepartments()`: Observable<{ [key: string]: string }>
- `getEventsList()`: Observable<{ [key: string]: string }>

#### 3. Admin Panel Component
**Location**: `frontend/src/app/components/admin-panel/`

Updates:
- Changed department and event input fields to dropdowns
- Loads departments and events from backend on init
- Submits only department IDs (e.g., "DEPT001") instead of names
- Shows success message indicating leaderboard will be updated

**HTML Changes**:
- Event dropdown shows: "Event Name - EVENT_ID"
- Department dropdowns show: "Department Name - DEPT_ID"
- All dropdowns include "Select..." placeholder

#### 4. Home Component
**Location**: `frontend/src/app/components/home/`

**TypeScript Updates**:
- Implements `OnDestroy` lifecycle hook
- Adds `leaderboard` array to store ChampionsCount data
- Loads leaderboard on component init
- Sets up auto-refresh using RxJS `interval(300000)` (5 minutes)
- Cleans up subscription on component destroy

**HTML Updates**:
- Added leaderboard section between events and coordinators sections
- Displays top 5 departments with:
  - Rank number (1-5)
  - Medal emoji for top 3 (ü•áü•àü•â)
  - Department name and ID
  - Score (number of wins)
- Shows "No results yet" message if leaderboard is empty
- Displays "Updates automatically every 5 minutes" message

**CSS Updates**:
- Added `leaderboard-section` with gradient background
- Styled leaderboard items with:
  - Different styles for 1st, 2nd, 3rd place
  - Gold gradient for 1st place
  - Silver gradient for 2nd place
  - Bronze gradient for 3rd place
  - Hover effects and animations
  - Bouncing medal animation
  - Slide-in animation for items
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Database Configuration

### MongoDB (Atlas)
Used for storing:
- Events (EVENTS collection)
- Event Results (EVENT_RESULTS collection)
- Credentials

### Neon PostgreSQL
Used for storing:
- Notifications
- **Champions Count (champions_count table)** ‚Üê NEW

Configuration in `application.properties`:
